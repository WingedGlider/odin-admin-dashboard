Admin Dashboard in the Intermediate HTML and CSS Course for The Odin Project

I feel pretty good about this one, primarily stayed with the source material for the design,
although it is not mobile responsive and abuses hidden overflow a bit too much.

Future changes will be focused on media breakpoints for mobile sizes, and small visual uplifts.
